## 🎯 Why I Created This ? <br>
As an active job seeker, I faced a common problem that many others do: the struggle to keep track of all the jobs I had applied to. With so many applications, it became increasingly difficult to remember the details — which jobs I had followed up with, which ones I hadn’t heard back from, and which opportunities I might have missed. There were times I found myself in situations where I either forgot to follow up or didn’t keep proper track of application statuses, potentially losing valuable chances.

This is where the idea for this tracker came from. I needed a solution that would allow me to organize my applications, track their status, and ensure I didn’t miss any key steps. By creating this Job Application Tracker, I not only solved my own problem but also aimed to help others avoid the same struggles.

Through this, I was able to leverage my problem-solving skills to create an efficient and user-friendly tool that brings structure and clarity to the job-seeking process. <br>
